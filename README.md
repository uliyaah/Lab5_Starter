1. You would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because unit tests cannot test how individual components of writing and sending interact with each other on a feature level.

2. You would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because this tests the individual part of the code of preventing the user from typing more than 80 characters.
